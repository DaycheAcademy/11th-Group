in when I was young. My favorite toy as a child of seven years old was the 
dried fallen branches in the woods. There was a small one behind our house 
and it provided endless fun for me and my brothers and sisters. Collected
sticks and branches became our castle, our fort, and our play home. Wood 
pieces gave us play swords, fishing rods, umbrellas, and jungle gyms.
They were my best childhood toy because they contained so many other toys.
What I most loved to play with at eight years old was dirt marbles. We lived
in a neighborhood where there was an eternal pit of mud on the strip of grass 
in front of our apartment. My brothers and I would mix the smooth mud with 
sand from the side of the road, roll it into balls and leave them to dry in
 the hot afternoon sun."""
